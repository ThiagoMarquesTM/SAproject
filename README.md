# SAproject
SENAI-final-delivery

Here's a project that I've developed in conjunction with 2 other colleagues. While I worked mostly on the Node.js, JavaScript and back-end part, they developed the database (MySQL) and the front-end (CSS + HTML) structure.

This one is our course conclusion job. 
Credits to them: Lucas Piecharski (front-end) and Gustavo Marcelino (MySQL database).
